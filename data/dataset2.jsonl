He was converted to Christ at the age of 19 and then felt called to the Gospel ministry, but the doors of opportunity for study and ministry did not open immediately. He then got a job in a bank. When he was 21 years old, he left the bank and went to college, graduating as a mechanical engineer. He continued as a professional draftsman for a while, then he became a teacher of the blind. Later, failing health compelled him to give up his teaching career. After a prolonged rest, he became a manufacturer. When he was converted he had become a member of the Episcopal Church, but in 1882,he became a Baptist and was ordained as a Baptist minister two years later. He went directly from business into the ministry. His first charge was at Kennett Square, Pennsylvania; his second pastorate was at Fox Chase, Pennsylvania, where he remained for 20 years. He was not a premillennialist at the time of his ordination, but his study of the Scriptures, with the help of some books that fell into his hands, led him to adopt the premillennialist position. He began to make large wall charts, which he titled, \"\"Prophetic Truth,\"\" for use in the pulpit. These led to his being invited to teach, in connection with his pastoral work, in two Bible institutes. During this time he published a number of prophetical charts, which were widely circulated. When World War I broke out in 1914, he was called on for addresses on The War and Prophecy. Then God laid it on his heart to prepare a work on Dispensational Truth (or God's Plan and Purpose in the Ages), containing a number of charts with descriptive matter. He spent three years of his life designing and drawing the charts and preparing the text. The favorable reception it has had since it was first published in 1918 seems to indicate that the world was waiting for such a book. Because it had a large and wide circulation in this and other lands, the first edition was soon exhausted. It was followed by a second edition, and then, realizing that the book was of permanent value, Larkin revised it and expanded it, printing it in its present form. He went to be with the Lord on January 24, 1924.\"--This text refers to thePaperbackedition."}]}

In short chapters he aims his microscope at such highly touted foods as tomatoes, acai berries, curry and soy; additives like nitrites, artificial sweeteners, vitamins and fluoride; contaminants including pesticides, hormones, trans fats and dioxins; and what, for him, are suspect fads. Schwarcz contends that while there are no magical foods, a diet of mostly vegetables, fruits, whole grains and low-fat dairy products and moderation are key to good health. To help readers make informed choices, he ably cuts through many controversies and will likely stir up a few (he challenges those who condemn milk consumption, espouse detoxification and promote kosher foods, for example). Schwarcz makes learning fun by peppering his text with fascinating facts (coffee contains naturally occurring carcinogens, and apples have formaldehyde). More importantly, he leaves readers with a rational framework for evaluating the complex nature of foods and how they affect health.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As a district officer in the Sudan Political Service, Thesiger had further opportunities to travel in desert lands and meet nomadic tribes. During World War II, he served with Orde Wingate's troops, liberating Abyssinia from the Italians; later, he fought behind the lines in the Western Desert.

Canada, for coverage of so vast a territory, engaged 100 international photographers (to Israelis ' mostly native 55), to produce 100,000 images (to Israelis ' 40,000), from which its several hundred memorable black-and-white and color illustrations were chosen. The photos juxtapose the industrial to the rural. A lively essay recounts experiences organizing the project and photographing on the actual day (June 8, 1984). The photographers get credit next to their pictures; a map shows where each worked that day; and a lengthy section gives their respective backgrounds, illustrated with past work. Israelis seems earnest, even somber, in comparison. With more than 300 equally fine images, it plays down the individual artists, presenting only a list of credits at the end. The introduction discusses not so much this project as the past and present social and political developments in this young nation, placing the images firmly in context. And indeed, throughout the coverage of agriculture, sheep, beaches, and apartment houses are the ubiquitous soldiers with guns. The heat and aridity are everywhere evident on this day (May 10, 1984) in the ``green'' month, before things are parched to brown. Both books use a chronological arrangement and tell when, to the hour, the pictures were taken, but Canada , being so large, offers maps on each page to show the geographical location of particular images.

As symbols of fertility, they are present in mythology  worldwide, from the creation myths of Tibet, China, Korea and India in  the East to the classical myth of the birth of Venus in the West. They  have long been the subject of popular sea ballads and chanties, and  have inspired works of music, literature and art by many a brilliant  soul, including Franz Joseph Haydn, Oscar Wilde, T.S. Eliot and Paul  Gaugin. A subject of feminist history and women's studies, mermaids  have been represented in popular culture in many forms: advertising,  music videos and successful Hollywood films.This lavish gift book,  replete with many special features, including vellum pages, metallic  ink, an enchanting gatefold, a fortune-telling mermaid and a mermaid  tattoo, is a tactile, enticing trip under the sea. Author Theodore  Gachot discusses the archetypal appeal and multifaceted symbolism of  the mermaid -- as goddess, heroine, fertility symbol and ocean spirit  -- throughout time and across cultures. A range of stunning artwork and  excerpts from literature enhance every alluring page, while a  comprehensive sources section enables readers to locate mermaid art and  decorative accessories."}]}

Only the Bible and works by Shakespeare have outdistanced her. Problems at Pollensa Bay & Other Stories provides a delightful addition to this vast body of writing by \"the mistress of mystery.\" Though these eight stories are not new, several are less well known, and this audiobook represents an exciting renewal of one of the world's most popular authors. \"The Harlequin Tea Set,\" thought to be Dame Agatha's last short story, is a tale of mistaken identity and features Mr. Saterthwaite and Harley Quin, who also appear together in \"The Love Detectives,\" a little-known story about a messy love triangle. Mr. Parker Pyne, Christie's goverment statistician turned detective, is called upon to save a love-struck young man in the title story. Also included is a mystery involving the eccentric and slightly pompous Hercule Poirot. The audiobook is narrated by Jonathan Cecil, whose superb vocal adaptations greatly enhance Dame Agatha's work. This is an excellent production, highly entertaining, and a most worthwhile purchase for any library.?Gretchen Browne, Rockville Centre P.L.,Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}]}
